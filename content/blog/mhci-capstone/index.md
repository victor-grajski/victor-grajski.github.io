overview: "For my capstone project for the Carnegie Mellon HCI Master's program, I'm working with a team of researchers and designers to reimagine the future of social interaction in automobiles with our client, 99P Labs. We are currently halfway through the project, having just concluded our major primary and secondary research efforts. To showcase our work so far, I designed and implemented a project website using Webflow and Figma. Moving into the summer, I'm exicted to put both my technical and design skills to work in building prototypes that enable more meaningful social interactions for families in the car. Check out our project teaser video below!"
