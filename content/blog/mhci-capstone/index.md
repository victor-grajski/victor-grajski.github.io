overview: "For my Carnegie Mellon HCI Master's Capstone project, I worked with a team of researchers and designers to reimagine family interaction in cars with our client, 99P Labs, an innovation lab within Honda. We ultimately developed Swervo, a product-service ecosystem that reimagines the car as a game console with the goal of fostering connection for families through unique combinations of play, interaction modalities, and the affordances of the car. My main contribution was building and user testing a smartphone-controlled robot, affectionately named Martin, using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Martin combines haptic and kinetic input, the movement of the car, and cooperative play to create shared presence for families. I also designed and built a responsive project website in React and Figma. Check out the project website and my GitHub to learn more about Martin."
