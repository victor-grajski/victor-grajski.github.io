overview: "For my first project at Peacock, I had the privilege of prototyping a new interactive feature called Choose Your Reality alongside fellow Design Engineers. The feature allows storytellers to introduce interactive moments into their content that branch off from the main cut. Our prototype used Real Housewives as a test case, and we allowed users to choose exclusive confessionals at key moments. To test our hypotheses and design decisions, our web-based prototype went through three rounds of moderated user testing on TVs, including one at Bravocon (think Comic-Con for reality TV fans). We even got written up in TechCrunch! I was honored to get to collaborate with so cross-functionally, and my main contribution was implementing the interactive modal as well as overseeing the user testing at Bravocon. Once the feature went live in production, it achieved a 25% CTR with the vast majority of those viewers engaging with every single piece of extra content, exceeding our most optimistic KPI projections. Note: the prototype is best viewed on desktop at a 16:9 aspect ratio as it's designed to simulate a TV experience. It can be controlled with the arrow, enter, and backspace keys. The first interactive moment is around the 13:50 mark. You can use the \"[\" and \"]\" keys to fast-forward/rewind."
