overview: "For my first project at Peacock, I had the privilege of prototyping a new interactive feature called Choose Your Reality alongside fellow Design Engineers. The feature allows storytellers to introduce interactive moments into their shows and movies that branch off from the main cut. Our prototype used Real Housewives as a test case, and we allowed users to choose exclusive confessionals from particular housewives following a dinner scene. To understand people's preferences around streaming interactivity, dial in the appropriate level of interactivity, and arrive at the spec we delivered to engineering, our web prototype went through three rounds of moderated user testing on TV devices, including one at Bravocon (think Comic-Con for reality TV fans). We even got written up in TechCrunch! I was honored to get to collaborate with so many stakeholders – designers, design engineers, researchers, product managers, copywriters, marketers, executives – and my main contribution was implementing the interactive modal functionality, styling, and animations as well as overseeing the user testing at Bravocon."
