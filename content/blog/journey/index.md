## Overview

Journey is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between psychotherapy sessions through structured journaling and session-related activities. I served as the lead designer for the project, and I worked with two user researchers to generate insights and evaluate my designs.

Stay tuned for a deeper case study, and in the meantime, please check out the prototypes and the presentation!
