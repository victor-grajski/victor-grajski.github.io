overview: "For my final project at Peacock, I led prototyping for a new way to browse the most popular titles on desktop web. Over the course of 3 months, I built and tested two major versions of the prototype. Because the primary goal was to get users to video content as quickly as possible since that had proven to increase engagement, we took advantage of hover behavior to show trailers for each title while preserving ease of traversing the whole list. This was a challenge, especially at the edges of the viewport and while panning across the list, and I spent a lot of time making design decisions around the transitions and timing for each interaction to maintain an intuitive experience. The first version provided a more immersive experience with larger trailers, however, in the second version, we opted for a more casual experience that wouldn't take users as far from the rest of the browse page. Once in production, Web Top 10 helped Peacock not only achieve parity with its competitors but differentiate itself by providing an elevated experience through unique interactions and engaging inline trailers. While trying out the demo, you can press the \"c\" key to pull up a control panel and change the prototype version."
