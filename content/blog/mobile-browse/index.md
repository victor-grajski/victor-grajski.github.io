overview: "In an effort to increase engagement on the Peacock iOS Browse page, I supported another Design Engineer in building out a new version of the page with the intention of playing video as soon as possible. To that effect, we tested two versions of the header row, my main contribution, one of which allowed users to swipe across, and the other of which used \"story bars\" much like Instagram Stories. This project was a wonderful opportunity to refresh and grow my SwiftUI skills, especially with respect to animation, and it increased the team's development velocity by serving as a foundation for future mobile prototypes."
