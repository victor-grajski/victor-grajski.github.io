overview: 'For my second project at Peacock, I led prototyping for a new and improved onboarding experience alongside a team of designers. The main focus of our efforts was improving how users personalize their experience when signing up on desktop web. To this end, I built a number of early-stage, "gray box" prototypes to explore different interaction paradigms like a deck of cards and a slot machine. Due to data science and engineering constraints, we moved toward a grid approach for subsequent prototypes. The designers quickly tested an initial Figma prototype in an unmoderated setting before I built a more robust version for a moderated user test in the lab. Following that test, I aided designers in refining the spec for engineering by giving them a control panel to adjust the properties of the interactions and animations I was implementing. This project was a wonderful opportunity to lead my first prototyping effort, work closely with designers early in the process, play a pivotal role in a lab session, and push the limits of my skills designing with code. Note: the prototype works best on Chrome at a screen size around 1400x900.'
