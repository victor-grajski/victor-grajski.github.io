overview: 'For my second major project at Peacock, I led prototyping for a more personalized onboarding experience on desktop web. To this end, I built a number of early-stage, "gray box" prototypes to explore different interaction paradigms like a deck of cards and a slot machine before settling on a grid approach. The designers quickly tested an initial Figma prototype in an unmoderated setting before I built a more robust version for a moderated user test in the lab. Following that test, I aided designers in refining the spec for engineering by giving them a control panel to adjust the properties of the interactions and animations I was implementing, saving them hours of time and effort. Once in production, 60% of new users completed the personalization process which was far above our initial hypothesis. Note: the prototype works best on Chrome at a screen size around 1400x900.'

shortDescription: "For my second major project at Peacock, I led prototyping for a more personalized onboarding experience. It pushed the limits of my skills collaborating with designers starting from 0 and implementing complex animations. The end result was a highly engaging experience that 60% of production users completed."
