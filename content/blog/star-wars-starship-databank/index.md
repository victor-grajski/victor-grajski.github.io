overview: "For my final project in the Programming Usable Interfaces course at Carnegie Mellon, I designed and developed a native mobile and tablet application for Star Wars fans to learn about starships from the franchise. Fans can filter by movie, see who piloted the ship, see which film(s) it appeared in, and save their favorites. Over the course of two weeks, I created and implemented a responsive design using Figma, React Native, and Expo. I chose to use React Native because I had never built something with it before, and I'd always wanted to learn how to use it. I learned a lot about how React Native works, and I had a lot of fun along the way geeking out on Star Wars!"
