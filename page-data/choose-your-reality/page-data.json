The feature allows storytellers to introduce interactive moments into their shows and movies that branch off from the main cut. Our prototype used Real Housewives as a test case, and we allowed users to choose exclusive confessionals from particular housewives following a dinner scene. To understand people's preferences around streaming interactivity, dial in the appropriate level of interactivity, and arrive at the spec we delivered to engineering, our web prototype went through three rounds of moderated user testing on TV devices, including one at Bravocon (think Comic-Con for reality TV fans). We even got written up in TechCrunch! I was honored to get to collaborate with so many stakeholders – designers, design engineers, researchers, product managers, copywriters, marketers, executives – and my main contribution was implementing the interactive modal functionality, styling, and animations as well as overseeing the user testing at Bravocon.","role":"Design Engineer","duration":"3 months","year":2022,"tools":"React, GraphQL, Next.js, Vercel, Figma","link":"https://peacock-prototype-web.vercel.app/","linkSource":"View Prototype (password protected)","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/d599b1e555cf1d494243895621e39c61/40a76/thumbnail.png","srcSet":"/static/d599b1e555cf1d494243895621e39c61/c972b/thumbnail.png 340w,\n/static/d599b1e555cf1d494243895621e39c61/27625/thumbnail.png 680w,\n/static/d599b1e555cf1d494243895621e39c61/40a76/thumbnail.png 1360w,\n/static/d599b1e555cf1d494243895621e39c61/1e49b/thumbnail.png 2040w,\n/static/d599b1e555cf1d494243895621e39c61/7148e/thumbnail.png 2720w,\n/static/d599b1e555cf1d494243895621e39c61/ba485/thumbnail.png 2936w","sizes":"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/choose-your-reality/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/peacock-onboarding/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Peacock - Onboarding","description":"Improving personalization during the onboarding process"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/mhci-capstone/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Honda Capstone","description":"Reifying family interaction in automobiles"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
